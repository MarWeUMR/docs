# QueryRectangle

A query rectangle defines a multi-dimensional spatial query in Geo Engine.
It consists of three parts:

- a two-dimensional spatial bounds (and extent plus its spatial reference system),
- a time interval,
- a spatial resolution.

The spatial bounds behave differently for raster, vector, or plot queries.
For raster queries, the spatial bounds define a spatial partition.
This means the lower right corner of the spatial bounds is not included in the query.
For vector queries, the spatial bounds define a bounding box, i.e., a rectangle where all bounds are included.
Plot queries behave like vector queries.
